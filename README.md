# Unibo MSc AI Notes

My notes for the courses of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna.

LaTeX source files are in the [`main` branch](https://github.com/NotXia/unibo-ai-notes/tree/main).\
Compiled PDF files are in the [`pdfs` branch](https://github.com/NotXia/unibo-ai-notes/tree/pdfs).

**Note**: I'm terrible at taking notes. Please ~~double~~ triple check everything before using it.
