\chapter{Ontologies}

\begin{description}
    \item[Ontology] \marginnote{Ontology} 
        Formal (non-ambiguous) and explicit (obtainable through a finite sound procedure) 
        description of a domain.

    \item[Category] \marginnote{Category}
        Can be organized hierarchically on different levels of generality.

    \item[Object] \marginnote{Object}
        Belongs to one or more categories.

    \item[Upper/general ontology] \marginnote{Upper/general ontology} 
        Ontology focused on the most general domain.

        Properties:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Should be applicable to almost any special domain.
            \item Combining general concepts should not incur in inconsistences.
        \end{itemize}

        Approaches to create ontologies:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Created by philosophers/logicians/researchers.
            \item Automatic knowledge extraction from well-structured databases.
            \item Created from text documents (e.g. web).
            \item Crowd-sharing information.
        \end{itemize}

\section{Categories}
\begin{description}
    \item[Category] \marginnote{Category}
        Used in human reasoning when the goal is category-driven (in contrast to specific-instance-driven).

        In first order logic, categories can be represented through:
        \begin{descriptionlist}
            \item[Predicate] \marginnote{Predicate categories}
                A predicate to tell if an object belongs to a category 
                (e.g. \texttt{Car(c1)} indicates that \texttt{c1} is a car).

            \item[Reification] \marginnote{Reification}
                Represent categories as objects as well (e.g. $\texttt{c1} \in \texttt{Car}$).
        \end{descriptionlist}
\end{description}

\subsection{Reification properties and operations}
\begin{description}
    \item[Membership] \marginnote{Membership}
        Indicates if an object belongs to a category.
        (e.g. $\texttt{c1} \in \texttt{Car}$).

    \item[Subclass] \marginnote{Subclass}
        Indicates if a category is a subcategory of another one.
        (e.g. $\texttt{Car} \subset \texttt{Vehicle}$).

    \item[Necessity] \marginnote{Necessity}
        Members of a category enjoy some properties 
        (e.g. $(\text{x} \in \texttt{Car}) \rightarrow \texttt{hasWheels(x)}$).

    \item[Sufficiency] \marginnote{Sufficiency}
        Sufficient conditions to be part of a category\\
        (e.g. $\texttt{hasPlate(x)} \land \texttt{hasWheels(x)} \rightarrow \texttt{x} \in \texttt{Car}$).

    \item[Category-level properties] \marginnote{Category-level properties}
        Category themselves can enjoy properties\\
        (e.g. $\texttt{Car} \in \texttt{VehicleType}$)

    \item[Disjointness] \marginnote{Disjointness}
        Given a set of categories $S$, the categories in $S$ are disjoint iff they all have different objects:
        \[ \texttt{disjoint($S$)} \iff (\forall c_1, c_2 \in S, c_1 \neq c_2 \rightarrow c_1 \cap c_2 = \emptyset) \]

    \item[Exhaustive decomposition] \marginnote{Exhaustive decomposition}
        Given a category $c$ and a set of categories $S$, $S$ is an exhaustive decomposition of $c$ iff
        any element in $c$ belongs to at least a category in $S$:
        \[ \texttt{exhaustiveDecomposition($S$, $c$)} \iff (\forall o \in c \iff \exists c_2 \in S: o \in c_2) \]

    \item[Partition] \marginnote{Partition}
        Given a category $c$ and a set of categories $S$, $S$ is a partition of $c$ when:
        \[ \texttt{partition($S$, $c$)} \iff \texttt{disjoint($S$)} \land \texttt{exhaustiveDecomposition($S$, $c$)} \]
\end{description}


\subsection{Physical composition}
Objects (meronyms) are part of a whole (holonym).

\begin{description}
    \item[Part-of] \marginnote{Part-of}
        If the objects have a structural relation (e.g. $\texttt{partOf(cylinder1, engine1)}$).

        Properties:
        \begin{descriptionlist}
            \item[Transitivity] $\texttt{partOf(x, y)} \land \texttt{partOf(y, z)} \rightarrow \texttt{partOf(x, z)}$
            \item[Reflexivity] $\texttt{partOf(x, x)}$
        \end{descriptionlist}

    \item[Bunch-of] \marginnote{Bunch-of}
        If the objects do not have a structural relation.
        Useful to define a composition of countable objects
        (e.g. $\texttt{bunchOf({nail1, nail3, nail4})}$).
\end{description}


\subsection{Measures}

A property of objects.

\begin{description}
    \item[Quantitative measure] \marginnote{Quantitative measure}
        Something that can be measured using some unit\\
        (e.g. $\texttt{length(table1)} = \texttt{cm(80)}$).

        Qualitative measures propagate when using \texttt{partOf} or \texttt{bunchOf} 
        (e.g. the weight of a car is the sum of its parts).

    \item[Qualitative measure] \marginnote{Qualitative measure}
        Something that can be measured using terms with a partial or total order relation
        (e.g. $\{ \texttt{good}, \texttt{neutral}, \texttt{bad} \}$).

        Qualitative measures do not propagate when using \texttt{partOf} or \texttt{bunchOf}.

    \item[Fuzzy logic] \marginnote{Fuzzy logic}
        Provides a semantics to qualitative measures (i.e. convert qualitative to quantitative).
\end{description}


\subsection{Things vs stuff}

\begin{description}
    \item[Intrinsic property] \marginnote{Intrinsic property}
        Related to the substance of the object. It is retained when the object is divided
        (e.g. water boils at 100°C).

    \item[Extrinsic property] \marginnote{Extrinsic property}
        Related to the structure of the object. It is not retained when the object is divided
        (e.g. the weight of an object changes when split).

    \item[Substance] \marginnote{Substance}
        Category of objects with only intrinsic properties.

        \begin{description}
            \item[Stuff] \marginnote{Stuff}
                The most general substance category.
        \end{description}

    \item[Count noun] \marginnote{Count noun}
        Category of objects with only extrinsic properties.

        \begin{description}
            \item[Things] \marginnote{Things}
                The most general object category.
        \end{description}
\end{description}
